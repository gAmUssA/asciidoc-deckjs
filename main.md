* [Latest version download][ad-download]

I have written a [tutorial-slide for illustration](./tutorial-slide.html). The source code of the tutorial-slide can be found [here](./tutorial-slide.asciidoc).

Writing Deck.js slides with AsciiDoc is very simple, I suggest you get start with [this template](./example-template.asciidoc).

You can checkout all the related code in [this repository][this-repo].
